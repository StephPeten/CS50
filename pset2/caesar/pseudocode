Make sure that the program is running via one command-line argument only
Make sure that all the characters of the prompted argument are digits
Convert that command-line argument from a string to an int (forgot about this one :o)
Prompt the user for plaintext
Then print the ciphertext after we used the key while remembering that :
- uppercase need to stay uppercase
- lowercase need to stay lowercase
- any other character need to stay the same as in plaintext
Print a newline
