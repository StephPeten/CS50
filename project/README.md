Hello World !

This is my CS50 Final Project.
It's a web based application that is using Python, SQL, Javascript, and an API called Xotelo that allows me to get prices for hotels
by returning to the API a certain number of parameters.
The reason behind that is the reason why I started CS50. I'm opening soon an Online Travel Agency (go check goaltrottercom on IG !)
and even if I won't be the one that will build the website, I wanted to understand that computer/programming world better and to know what's happening there.

But without further ado, I will explain my project.
CS5OTA is an Online Travel Agency that will allow the customer to check which destination he would like to visit among our destinations, and to suggest new destinations
that we will add on the website. He just needs to insert the date of his trip and the price will be calculated automatically depending on the parameters that the client
will give and thanks to the API.
On the other side, the OTA can also register and have an insight to the management part of the website.
In this part, the manager will be able to add new destinations, to change the commissions of the agency and to consult the suggestions that the customers posted,
in order to see which destination add next time !

I hope you will enjoy it !

PS : if you have an error while trying to access the destination, it's because the API didn't return any result. Just change the dates or the number of people !

Have Fun !
